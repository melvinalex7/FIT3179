              According to scientific studies, happier nations have longer life expectancy rates. 
              This could be because to various factors, such as the fact that happier nations typically have higher levels of social cohesiveness and trust, which can result in better health outcomes. 
              Aside from that, happy nations typically have greater economic development, which can increase access to better healthcare and other amenities that promote health and longevity.  
              Also, happier nations tend to have more effective public health institutions and policies, which can also lead to improved health outcomes.</p>
              
              It is important to mention that happiness is only one of several elements that can influence life expectancy. In addition, factors like access to healthcare, education, and income are crucial.
